INTRODUCTION

This is a collection of various functions that I've worked on the last weeks to streamline my mission making. 
None of them are revolutionary but all of them have been designed with efficiency, modularity and performance in mind. 
The idea is to reduce the need for repetitive scripting as much as possible while avoiding the need for third-party scripts and the problems that come with that. 
I've also tried and comment everything as best as possible to make understanding the code easier.



SETUP

Unzip the archive to your mission root folder. You should now have a ws_fnc folder with various subfolders inside.

ArmA 2:
[] call compile preProcess "ws_fnc\ws_fnc_init.sqf" from either your init.sqf or a unit init field.
You can delete the description.ext that is inside ws_fnc\

ArmA 3:
If your mission does not have a description.ext you can move the description.ext from ws_fnc\ to your mission root folder.
If your mission does have a description.ext open the descripion.ext inside ws_fnc\ and paste the code within the cfgFunctions scope at the bottom of your own description.ext. If the cfgFunctions scope does not exist yet, simply cope the entire scope over.



DOCUMENTATION

All major functions are documented in themselves. To see how they work open their .sqf with a text editor or their pages on github. If you're running ArmA 3 then you can also seem them all in the editor when opening the function viewer (CTRL+G). Make sure to select "missionConfigFile" in the top-left drop-down menu.
