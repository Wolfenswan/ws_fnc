INTRODUCTION

This is a collection of various functions that I've worked on the last weeks to streamline my mission making. 
None of them are revolutionary but all of them have been designed with efficiency, modularity and performance in mind. 
The idea is to reduce the need for repetitive scripting as much as possible while avoiding the need for third-party scripts and the problems that come with that. 
I've also tried and comment everything as best as possible to make understanding the code easier.



SETUP

Unzip the archive to your mission root folder. You should now have a ws_fnc folder with various subfolders inside.

ArmA 2:
[] call compile preProcessFile "ws_fnc\ws_fnc_init.sqf" from either your init.sqf or a unit init field.

DOCUMENTATION

All major functions are documented in themselves. To see how they work open their .sqf with a text editor or their pages on github.
